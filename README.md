## Allure Tanquintic - Frontend Engineer

### What I was able to accomplish:

- Fix bugs that was causing the app to create a todo item twice
- Save and load data using localStorage
- Edit Mode: Double-click to edit an item
  - Press Enter to save
  - Press Esc or click outside the item to exit and disregard edit
- Improved UI/UX (responsive)
- Unit Tests (for App.tsx, reducer.ts, and action.ts)

### How to run tests

- Run `yarn test`

### Things that I would like to add if given more time

- Complete unit tests
- Login feature
- Theme picker
- Priority and draggable item feature
